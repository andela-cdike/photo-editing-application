#### Application Overview

Neatpix is a simple web app that allows users to upload their photos to the cloud, apply and save filters/effects to these photos and then share them on social media. In addition, the app also lets users download their edited photos to desktop. Social media support is limited to Facebook for this initial version.

The Neatpix app will be built using a number of web development technologies and services, some of which include:

+ [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) &nbsp;- Python web development framework for building web apps quickly and with less code.
+ [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) &nbsp;- relational database management system.
+ [Bower](http://bower.io/) &nbsp;- front end javascript dependency manager.
+ [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) &nbsp;- modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design.
+ [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) &nbsp;- fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.
+ [Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com/) &nbsp;- cloud-based image back-end for web and mobile development.
+ [Facebook Javascript SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript) &nbsp;- Facebook SDK for JavaScript for integrating client-side Facebook functionality into your web apps.
